# News and Social Media
This project investigates the influence news headlines have on social media - particularly, how sentiments are influenced. The project will consist of a few parts:
1. A custom NLP model that recognizes sentiment in news headlines and social media posts
2. An NLP system that identifies the topic of a headline and social media post
3. A time-series analysis measuring the influence of one on the other
4. An interactive webpage to explore the results
